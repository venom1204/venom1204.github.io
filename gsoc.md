### What is "data.table"?
The `data.table` package extends R’s base `data.frame`, offering a fast, concise, and memory-efficient toolkit for data manipulation. It's a staple in the R ecosystem, widely used by data professionals for handling large datasets with speed and clarity.


Key benefits of `data.table` include:
- Minimal and readable syntax
- Exceptional performance on large data
- Optimized memory usage
- Carefully managed API changes
- Supportive and active community
- Constantly evolving with new features

### About My Project


As part of GSoC 2025, my project involves contributing directly to `data.table` by addressing outstanding GitHub issues. My responsibilities will include bug fixes, documentation improvements, and implementing new features where needed.

Initially, I plan to resolve at least 10 minor issues aimed at enhancing usability, such as clarifying documentation and ensuring consistent behaviors. Once those are complete, I’ll move on to tackling more complex challenges

Through this project, I aim not only to close the issues outlined in my proposal but also to deepen my understanding of R and C programming, contribute meaningfully to open source, and grow through collaborative development with the `data.table` community.
