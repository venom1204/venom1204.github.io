### Making `tables()` Smarter: Recognizing Nested `data.table`s ([PR #7141](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7141), Closes [#2606](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2606))

Historically, `tables()` could only detect top-level `data.table` objects in the environment. However, many users store `data.table`s inside lists — especially after using functions like `split()`.

To improve usability:

- I extended `tables()` to optionally **recursively traverse plain lists** in the environment.
- This makes en-listed or split-generated `data.table`s visible in `tables(recursive = TRUE)`.
- Nested structures within `data.frame` or `data.table` columns are intentionally **excluded**, to avoid false positives or excessive recursion.
- The implementation was carefully designed to minimize performance overhead.

This addition improves discoverability and debugging workflows for complex environments and nested data.

### Safer `:=` Assignments: Guarding Against Function RHS ([PR #7161](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7161), Closes [#5829](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5829))

A subtle but dangerous misuse arises when users mistakenly assign a **function or closure** on the right-hand side (RHS) of `:=`. This led to malformed tables or cryptic error messages.

To prevent this:

- I added a check: if `jval` is a **function**, a clear error is raised before proceeding.
- The logic is scoped to cases where **new columns are being created**, ensuring no interference with valid operations.
- This check improves error diagnostics and guards against accidental misuse.

While this patch covers function closures, it lays the groundwork for handling other exotic types (e.g., environments, external pointers) in future iterations.

### Fixing Vignette Drift: Updating Reshape Examples to Match `fread()` Behavior ([PR #7150](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7150), Closes [#6524](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6524))

The `reshape` vignette contained an outdated example where `fread()` used to read `dob_child` columns as `character`. Now, thanks to improved auto-type detection, they’re read as `IDate` — which broke the original teaching point around type coercion.

To address this:

- I **replaced `dob_child` columns** with `name_child` columns (strings like "Anna", "Ben").
- This restored the original coercion conflict between character and integer types.
- Surrounding text was updated to reflect the new example and maintain pedagogical clarity.

This fix ensures the vignette remains relevant and educational for new users learning reshaping.

### Improved Print Formatting: Dynamic Column Widths when `col.names = "none"` ([PR #7130](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7130), Closes [#6882](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6882))

When printing `data.table`s with `col.names = "none"`, column widths were previously hardcoded — often resulting in misaligned or clipped output.

To fix this:

- I modified the logic to **dynamically determine column widths** based on the data, even when no headers are printed.
- This leads to cleaner, more legible output in customized printing contexts.
- The patch includes a targeted test and keeps output alignment consistent across use cases.

### Silencing Spurious Warnings in `cube()` Eval ([PR #7110](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7110), Closes [#6964](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6964))

Using `cube()` triggered confusing warnings from `min()` or `max()` like:
