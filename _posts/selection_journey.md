### How It All Began

My journey with **data.table** began in dec 2024 when I was exploring active open-source projects. I stumbled upon `data.table`, a package that stood out due to its efficient syntax and blazing-fast execution even on large datasets. As someone interested in both R and system-level performance, I found this project to be the perfect fit.

Initially, I found it a bit overwhelming to dive into such a well-established codebase. There were many C-level optimizations and low-level implementations that weren’t immediately easy to understand. I had to spend time learning the internals—especially the hybrid use of R and C—which was both challenging and rewarding.
### First Steps

The first real hurdle I faced was understanding the overall architecture of the project and how the R functions interact with the underlying C codebase. It took some time to get familiar with the design patterns and how various components of the package work together under the hood. Diving into older GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions provided valuable historical context and helped me gradually build a clearer understanding of the system.
### Why GSoC?

Once I learned that `data.table` was participating in **Google Summer of Code**, I knew it was the opportunity I had been preparing for. I began drafting a proposal that aligned with the existing roadmap and addressed areas I believed I could contribute to meaningfully—performance optimizations, bug fixes, and documentation improvements.

The support from the mentors and community has been phenomenal. They are always encouraging, give detailed code reviews, and help ensure that each contribution moves the project forward.

### What’s Next?

As I officially begin my GSoC journey, I am incredibly excited and motivated to work alongside the brilliant minds behind `data.table`. I aim to:
- Close several long-standing issues and improve user experience.
- Enhance performance in grouped operations.
- Simplify and improve documentation for new users and contributors.

This opportunity is not just a summer project for me—it's a launchpad into long-term open source contribution and collaborative software development.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue this exciting journey with the `data.table` team!
