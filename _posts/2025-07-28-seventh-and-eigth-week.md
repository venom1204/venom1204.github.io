### Consistent and Clear: Unifying `:=` Error Messages (PR in Progress, [#4920](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4920))

During these weeks, a key focus was on refining the user experience, starting with one of `data.table`'s most powerful yet sometimes tricky features: the `:=` assignment operator. When used inside a `{}` block, `:=` has specific rules that can trip up newcomers. To address this, I've worked on making the error messages significantly more helpful and consistent.

The improvements are designed to guide users toward the correct syntax, transforming a moment of frustration into a learning opportunity:

-   **Clarifying the Core Rule**: The primary `stopf()` messages in `R/data.table.R` were updated to be more direct and educational. The new message explicitly states: "`:=` must be the only statement inside `{}` and may only appear once." This removes ambiguity about how `:=` should be structured within a block.
-   **Guiding Users to a Solution**: Beyond stating the rule, the error now proactively suggests a best practice for complex, multi-step operations: using `{}` on the *right-hand side* of `:=`. This simple hint empowers users to write clean, efficient code for assignments that require intermediate logic.
-   **Anticipating Common Mistakes**: The general error message for `:=` misuse was enhanced to hint at frequent errors, such as mistakenly using the base R assignment `<-` or including multiple expressions alongside `:=` within the same `{}`.
-   **Improving Documentation**: To reinforce this guidance, a note was added to the `assign.Rd` documentation file. It formally explains the "single statement" rule for `:=` inside `{}` and points users toward using the functional form of `:=` for updating multiple columns, ensuring the information is discoverable through official channels.

These coordinated changes ensure that when a user makes a mistake with `:=`, they receive clear, instructive feedback that not only explains the problem but also guides them to the idiomatic `data.table` solution.

### Making New Helpers Discoverable: `cbindlist()` and `mergelist()` Examples (PR in Progress, [#7171](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/7171))

New functions are only as useful as they are discoverable. To ensure the recently introduced `cbindlist()` and `mergelist()` helpers gain immediate traction, I added concise, practical examples directly into the `NEWS.md` file. By placing examples in the release notes, users can immediately see the value of these new tools without having to search through the full documentation.

The examples were crafted to be clear and illustrative:

-   For **`cbindlist()`**, the example demonstrates its primary use case: a straightforward, column-wise concatenation of a list of `data.table`s. This gives users a quick mental model for how the function works.
-   For **`mergelist()`**, the examples showcase its versatility. One demonstrates a **recursive inner join**, merging a list of tables based on a common `id` key. Another shows how to perform a **left join**, highlighting the function's flexibility in handling different join types across multiple tables.

These small but significant additions act as a quick-start guide, lowering the barrier to adoption and helping users integrate these powerful new helpers into their workflows right away.

### Smoother Onboarding: Example for `sort_by()` (PR [#7196](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7196), Closes [#7140](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/7140))

The new `sort_by()` function introduces a powerful and expressive API for reordering `data.table` rows based on custom conditions. However, without a clear example, its unique syntax and potential might not be immediately obvious to users accustomed to traditional sorting methods.

To bridge this gap and ensure a smooth onboarding experience, I introduced a clear, minimal usage example into `NEWS.md`.

-   This addition provides an **at-a-glance demonstration** of `sort_by()`, allowing users browsing the release notes to instantly grasp its purpose and core functionality.
-   By complementing the comprehensive official documentation, this example serves as a "first step," giving users the confidence and initial understanding needed to start experimenting with the function on their own data.

This effort ensures that `sort_by()` is not just a powerful feature in theory, but an accessible and easily adopted tool in practice.

### Strengthening Date Support: Adding `isoyear()` (PR [#7197](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7197), Closes [#7154](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/7154))

A significant enhancement this period was the introduction of the `isoyear()` function, filling a long-standing gap in `data.table`'s date and time capabilities. Many business and analytical workflows, especially in finance, logistics, and retail, rely heavily on the **ISO 8601 week-based calendar**. A critical challenge in this system is that weeks can cross calendar year boundaries—for instance, the first week of an ISO year can begin in late December of the previous calendar year.

While `data.table` already provided a highly efficient `isoweek()` function, there was no native way to extract the corresponding **ISO year**. This forced users to rely on cumbersome workarounds or external packages for a complete solution.

To address this, I implemented `isoyear()`:

-   The implementation is a fast, robust wrapper around base R's proven `format()` function, ensuring both performance and reliability:
    ```r
    isoyear = function(x) as.integer(format(as.IDate(x), "%G"))
    ```
    This approach intelligently leverages `data.table`'s own `IDate` class and the `%G` format specifier, which is specifically designed to compute the ISO week-based year. It correctly handles all edge cases, such as `isoyear("2019-12-30")`, which correctly returns `2020` because that date belongs to ISO week 1 of 2020.

-   To guarantee its correctness, I added a comprehensive suite of **unit tests**. These tests cover critical boundary conditions, including December–January transitions, leap years, and various other scenarios where calendar and ISO years diverge.

-   The function was fully integrated into the package with updates to **documentation, the NAMESPACE, and `NEWS.md`**, making `isoyear()` easy for users to discover, understand, and apply.

With the addition of `isoyear()`, `data.table` now provides a **complete and complementary pair alongside `isoweek()`**. This empowers users to perform sophisticated grouping, aggregation, and analysis by ISO periods natively and efficiently, solidifying `data.table`'s standing as a self-contained tool for high-performance data manipulation.

Weeks 7 and 8 focused on **polishing the user experience** across the board. From improving error guidance to make the learning curve gentler, to making new helpers like `cbindlist()`, `mergelist()`, and `sort_by()` more approachable through clear examples, the goal was to refine the package's ergonomics. Capping it off, filling a long-standing functional gap with robust ISO calendar support further empowers users in their analytical tasks. These refinements help make `data.table` not only more powerful but also more intuitive and pleasant to use.
