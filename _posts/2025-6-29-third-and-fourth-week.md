### Extending Join Semantics: Smarter Handling of Complex Types (PR [#7085](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7085), Closes [#6627](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6627))

In `data.table`, `bmerge()` powers fast keyed joins — but until now, it hadn’t explicitly supported joins involving **complex vectors**. This created ambiguity in behavior and left a subtle gap in our type coercion logic.

To resolve this:

- I added checks to detect when a join column is of type `complex`.
- If all imaginary parts are zero, the column is safely **coerced to double**, preserving join integrity.
- If any imaginary component is non-zero, a clear and informative **error is raised**, pointing to the specific column.
- All changes were covered with new **unit tests** and designed to integrate cleanly into the existing coercion table.

This aligns join behavior with user expectations and provides clearer diagnostics for unsupported types — a small fix that unlocks broader consistency.

### Clarifying `by` Semantics: List vs Parentheses (PR [#7078](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7078), Closes [#2391](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2391))

For a long time, the syntax for the `by` argument — especially the difference between `list()` and parentheses — has confused users. While both forms work, they behave differently when naming expressions.

To reduce this friction:

- I updated `.Rd` docs to explain how **single expressions** in `by` work with or without `list()`.
- In `programming.Rmd`, I added **practical examples** showing the difference in **naming**, **grouping**, and **evaluation** between `list()` and `()` — and why users might prefer one over the other.
- I also pointed out **common pitfalls**, like inconsistent naming or misleading column names in grouped results.

This improves onboarding for new users and deepens the documentation’s clarity for more advanced use cases.

### Fixing Side Effects in `frank()` (PR [#7072](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7072), Closes [#5617](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5617))

The `frank()` function is designed to rank elements efficiently, but a long-standing issue caused it to **silently mutate inputs** — particularly lists and atomic vectors with named components.

To fix this:

- I introduced **explicit deep copying** of list and atomic inputs before processing.
- This ensures that neither names nor attributes are lost due to internal conversions like `setDT()`.
- The behavior now matches user expectations: `frank(x)` ranks without side effects.

### Preserving `.internal.selfref` in `setDT()` with `get0()` (PR [#7101](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7101), Closes [#6864](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6864))

A nuanced bug in `setDT()` caused self-reference attributes to go missing when converting data retrieved via `get0()`. This led to subtle issues like `identical(x, y)` returning `FALSE` even when content matched.

To resolve this:

- I extended the internal logic to **recognize `get0()`**, just like it already did for `get()`.
- This ensures `.internal.selfref` is correctly preserved, maintaining **pointer consistency** and **reference semantics**.
- The fix includes tests and avoids regressions in related behaviors.

### Minor But Meaningful: Vignette Sequence Fix (PR [#7081](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7081))

Lastly, I made a **small correction** in the joins vignette to fix section numbering and maintain structural clarity. It’s a simple patch, but these little touches matter when you're maintaining documentation for thousands of users.

Weeks 3 and 4 have focused on **correctness, clarity, and consistency** — fixing deep-rooted edge cases and improving the surfaces users interact with every day. It’s been exciting to smooth out these rough edges and contribute to a more robust and intuitive `data.table`.

Stay tuned for more improvements in the weeks ahead!
